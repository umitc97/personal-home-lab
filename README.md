Currently focused on building my skills in **IT support**, **Windows systems**, and **PowerShell scripting**.

My current goals are 
- Learn and apply CompTIA A+ concepts
- Create a virtual IT lab using VirtualBox
- Practice basic automation with PowerShell

Tools & Technologies are
- Windows 10/11
- PowerShell (beginner)
- VirtualBox
- Git & GitHub
Personal Projects:
I'll be uploading simple scripts, system setups, and lab notes as I learn.
